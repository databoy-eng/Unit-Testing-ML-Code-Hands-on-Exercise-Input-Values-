# Unit-Testing-ML-Code-Hands-on-Exercise-Input-Values-
In this notebook we will explore unit tests to validate input data using a basic schema
We will use a classic toy dataset: the Iris plants dataset, which comes included with scikit-learn
Dataset details: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#iris-plants-dataset

As we progress through the course, the complexity of examples will increase, but we will start with something basic. This notebook is designed so that it can be run in isolation, once the setup steps described below are complete.

Setup
Let's begin by importing the dataset and the libraries we are going to use. Make sure you have run pip install -r requirements.txt on requirements file located in the same directory as this notebook. We recommend doing this in a separate virtual environment (see dedicated setup lecture).

If you need a refresher on jupyter, pandas or numpy, there are some links to resources in the section notes.
